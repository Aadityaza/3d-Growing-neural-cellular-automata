# 3d-Growing-neural-cellular-automata
This project is inspired by the project "Growing Neural Cellular Automata" found at the link: https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/.

It explores the intriguing concept of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and its application in modeling complex morphogenetic processes. The primary aim is to learn the local-level rules that govern the growth of a structure from a single cell, ultimately leading to the creation of a specific type of structure.

The project's objective is to develop an extension of the methodology described in the paper "Growing Neural Cellular Automata" to enable the generation of complex structures in three dimensions. By harnessing the power of NCA, we strive to facilitate the creation of diverse and intricate three-dimensional structures.
